the project is located in the laptop.
/ML/RL/tensorflow_test
under which there is two folder:
13_lable_data_training
one_lable_data_training

this two are just train with one step for simulation the backpropagation (the real reinforcement learning is not run this way, only for study tensorflow)
the 13_lable_data_training is the correct version that could train exactly one Episode and include all 13 step.
